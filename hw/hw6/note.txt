Last sem we both go on a walk like around the campus just us and like talk about future goals and stuff and things like that. And I also did this sem ask her to lunch.
Oh and what ever u think i said weird like it is not what u think. I first met her then thought of her as a friend and then like since she is a girl I wanted to know a bit more and seelike if she check my boxes and the walk we went on did and then I developed feelings and 
I started treating her good and helping her and like talking to her about family. The walk we had cleared up that I wanted her as she checks all of my boxes and she is a good person.
